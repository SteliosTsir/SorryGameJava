# SorryGameJava

This project was completed as part of an assignment in the Computer Science Department at the University of Crete. The assignment was for the course HY252 - Object Oriented Programming.
<br />

As students we were asked to create a digital version of the board game "Sorry!" using object-oriented programming principles.

The project aims to teach us students key concepts such as system specification and design, implementation of abstract data types, inheritance, polymorphism, and graphical user interface creation in Java.

This project is a great opportunity for us to apply what we've learned about object-oriented programming and software design. We're learning how to define and implement abstract data types, and how to separate the game's core logic from its graphical interface, making our code more reusable and easier to maintain. It's challenging but also really rewarding to see the game come to life as we progress through each phase.
